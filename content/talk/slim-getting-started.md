Slim is a PHP micro framework that enables you to write powerful web applications and APIs. In this talk, I will give an overview of the upcoming version 3 of framework and show how you can easily write maintainable applications with it.

We will look at how Slim's middleware system leverages the new PSR-7 HTTP request and response definitions to create easily understandable and flexible applications. We will cover application setup, routing and the relationship between actions and middleware. By the end of the session, you will be equipped to create Slim applications yourself.
