We have been exploring the concept of Chat Ops pioneered at Github in which we utilise a chat-bot and group chat service to automate many of our tasks and it has changed the way we do ops across the company. Automating deployment, managing environments, and using chat integrations to monitor Github repos, logs and more has moved arcane tasks on the command line to conversations in Slack. Instead of having to access various services across the web or on the command line, our tools are now embedded in the conversations we have with each other every day. Empowering remote workers, simplifying tasks and supporting new team members with inline training, everything is in one place and easy to use.
