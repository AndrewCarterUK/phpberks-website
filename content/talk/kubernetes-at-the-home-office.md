This talk is about how to run your PHP applications in docker. I start by showing you how to run any container, then move onto how to build your own. Then I discuss the problems of managing docker in a multi node environment, and how Kubernetes solves these problems. I give an overview of Kubernetes and demonstrate how to use it. Finally I give a wrap up about how we use these tools to work openly and open source software to encourage reuse.
