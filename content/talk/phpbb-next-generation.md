phpBB is a forum software that has been around since 1999 and is possibly one of the oldest still developed and widely used open source PHP projects around. In 2007, phpBB 3.0 ‘Olympus’ was released, and since then we have embarked on an adventure for the next major release of phpBB – 3.1 (also called 3.2 and 4.0 in the past). This talk goes over where phpBB has come from since the Olympus release, the mistakes we’ve made, how our mindset changed to integrate Symfony into phpBB, how we now leverage external libraries and finally how we made it to making 3.1 a finished product, built using Symfony Components.
