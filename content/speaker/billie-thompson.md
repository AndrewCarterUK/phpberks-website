# Billie Thompson

Billie Thompson is a contracting software developer. Sheâ€™s been contracting from her own company [Purple Booth Ltd](https://purplebooth.co.uk/) for two and half years but has been working in software development for over six years. During that time she has got to play with lots of cool technology, everything from RabbitMQ, to NodeJS, to Puppet and beyond (as well as the usual suspects of Zend, Zend 2 and Symfony2). However primarily she's a PHP developer.
